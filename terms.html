    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 7, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Choicease</strong>. By using this website and software, you agree to the following Terms of Service, which are aligned with the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">GNU General Public License v3 (GPL v3)</a>.</p>

    <h2>1. License</h2>
    <p>
      Choicease is an open-source software, licensed under the GNU GPL v3.  
      This means you are free to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use</strong> the software for any purpose.</li>
      <li><strong>Study</strong> how it works and modify it.</li>
      <li><strong>Share</strong> copies with others.</li>
      <li><strong>Distribute</strong> your modified versions under the same license.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A copy of the full license is included in the <a href="LICENSE">LICENSE</a> file and available online at the GNU website.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Contributions</h2>
    <p>
      Contributions to this project are welcome. By submitting code, documentation, or design contributions, you agree that your work will be licensed under GPL v3 or a compatible license.  
      Please see our <a href="CONTRIBUTING.md">Contributing Guide</a> for details.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Intellectual Property & Branding</h2>
    <p>
      While the code is licensed under GPL v3, the <strong>Choicease</strong> name and logo are trademarks of the project maintainers.  
      You may use the code freely under GPL v3, but you may not use the Choicease brand identity (logo, name, or domain) in a way that implies official endorsement without prior permission.
    </p>

    <h2>4. No Warranty</h2>
    <p>
      This software is provided <em>“as is”</em>, without any warranty of any kind.  
      We disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to fitness for a particular purpose.  
      You assume full responsibility for your use of the software.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, Choicease contributors will not be liable for any damages arising from the use or inability to use the software, including loss of data, decisions made, or outcomes derived from the tool.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to These Terms</h2>

      We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. The latest version will always be posted on this page with a revised date.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about these Terms, please contact us at 
       <a id="emailLink"></a>.
    </p>
    <h2>8. Branding, White-Labelling, and Paid Services</h2>
    <p>
      The Choicease source code is licensed under the GNU GPL v3. The
      <strong>Choicease</strong> name, logo, and other brand assets (the “Choicease Branding”) are trademarks of the project maintainers and are <strong>not</strong> licensed under GPL v3.
      You may use and modify the code under GPL v3, but you may not use Choicease Branding without prior written permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choicease offers (or may offer) optional premium services such as white-labelled reports, custom branding, and managed deployments ("Premium Services"). These Premium Services may be provided for a fee. Making the code for white-labelling available under GPL does not prevent the maintainers from charging for value-added services.
    </p>
    <p>
      We recommend reviewing the LICENSE and CONTRIBUTING guidelines before submitting code or using branding in production. If you wish to use Choicease Branding commercially, please contact us for license and trademark permissions.
