- Visual results with score bars, rankings, and advanced analytics.
- Export decisions as **JSON, CSV, PDF, or QR codes**.
- 100% **private** – no backend, no data collection, everything runs in your browser.

## 🛠️ Development

This is a static front-end app. You only need a browser to run it.

### Run locally
```bash
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/choicease.git
cd choicease

# serve with Python (optional)
python -m http.server 8000
